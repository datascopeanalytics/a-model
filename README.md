There are a lot of levels at which we can try to better understand Datascope's
profitability and ability to grow. For as simple of a concept as
"profitability" is, it is inextricably linked to factors like personal
take-home pay, type of work we do (*poke my eyes out* tasks are less fun), and
amount of time we work. To get a better sense of this, the goal of this model
is to make it easier for everyone to understand how their personal goals are
tied to Datascope's.
